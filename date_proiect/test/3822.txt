the internal market , which falls within the competence of the Commission alone .
This proposal is intended to respond , as has already been said , to two fundamental issues : the performance of the duties of this European data protection supervisor , which have already been laid down in Council Regulation (EC ) No 45/2001 ; in other words , the issue of the pay of the European supervisor and deputy supervisor and the issue of where they are to be based .
This means that very little data of a more sensitive nature will fall within the scope of this European supervisor 's mandate , which gives legitimacy to the criticism of those who say that the pay package is probably excessive for a post with such limited duties .
Although these reports express some concern about universal access , minimum environmental rules , information and guaranteeing consumer choice and security of supply in every country , the fact is that taking the route towards the liberalisation and total opening up of the market will undermine these concerns .
The revision of the financial perspectives is absolutely essential to safeguarding the principle of economic and social cohesion , a genuinely distributive budget and the adequate financing of development and cooperation policy .
Hence our position against the report .
The violence we see throughout the world , particularly the situation of Afghan women under the Taliban regime , also exists , unfortunately , in other countries in which the dignity and will of women are trampled on for religious or ideological reasons .
The aim of this report is to secure a vote against all forms of fundamentalism .
I must also point out that in 2001 this reduction was closely connected to the rise in the value of the dollar and not to any reform of agricultural policy ; and I must also say that there have been substantial increases in the amounts of subsidies for all products not included in Annex I. This is a situation that concerns me and I should like to ask Commissioner Fischler if he thinks it realistic that these reforms of the CAP that he has been talking about will be carried out in good enough time to be able to gradually eliminate these export subsidies ?
The rapporteur nevertheless acknowledges and recommends an appropriate degree of flexibility , which is necessary if we are to use public policies as instruments of economic recovery , without making the zero deficit in 2004 an obsession that is disproportionate to today 's reality .
In its folly - as illustrated by the Minister of the Presidency Mr Lucas , a minister who is very close to the President of the Spanish Government - the Spanish Government is both trying to confine the internal constitutional bodies to a consultative role in the politically useless Committee of the Regions , and also , ignoring the reality of the Union , wants to turn this body into senate , even if this means going against proposals such as the one put forward by the German Chancellor , Gerhard Schroeder , who reserves this role of senate for the Council itself .
Mr President , I think it has become increasingly clear that issues of cooperation and of development today lie at the heart of international policy .
The European Parliament , for its part , has always seen decentralised cooperation to be a development approach that deserves all our support .
It is true that the issue deserves a debate with greater participation from us , not least because it deals with the codecision procedure , but the Commission submitted its proposal at a time when the regulation 's period in force was almost at an end , and if it is not adopted at first reading , a legal vacuum would be created that would damage precisely those that we are trying to support .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in this proposal , the Commission is seeking to amend the basic regulation on the common organisation of the market in tobacco ( Regulation ( EEC ) 2075/92 ) , fixing the premiums and guarantee thresholds for leaf tobacco by variety group and Member State for the 2002 , 2003 and 2004 harvests .
There are two reasons for this : first of all , the Commission launched an evaluation study of the COM in raw tobacco , which should enable an assessment to be made of the effects of current Community policy on the sector , and its conclusions will only be available at the end of 2002 ; secondly , it was the Commission itself that undertook to submit proposals on the new tobacco policy at the beginning of next year , but only on the basis of the studies that are now being carried out .
This amendment has two implications : firstly , not only accepting financing by the Fund of actions to prevent nicotine addiction and of experimental action to encourage tobacco producers to switch to other crops and economic activities , but also maintaining the financing of agronomic research into varieties of tobacco that are less damaging to the environment and to health ; and , secondly , increasing the levy on producers ' premiums from 2 % to 3 % , thereby rejecting both the present figure of 2 % , and the Commission 's proposal of 5 % .
( PT ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Regulation No 1587/1998 introducing a scheme to compensate for the additional costs incurred in the marketing of certain fishery products from the Azores , Madeira , the Canary Islands and the French departments of Guyana and RÃ©union as a result of those regions ' remoteness , like the regulations that preceded it , has proved to be a fisheries policy instrument of enormous and undeniable use in economic and social terms and even for safeguarding certain cultural values associated with fishing activities
