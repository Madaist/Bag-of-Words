Mr President of the Council , I welcome you on behalf of our group at your first appearance and I thank you for the work you have done during your presidency .
How can we distribute powers in this new Europe while reconciling democracy , accountability and efficiency ?
We believe your presidency was too modest in respect of the Kosovo crisis , the tension between India and Pakistan and when restoring the failed troika in Algeria .
Often reproaches are unjustified .
We should instead convince our fellow citizens that they owe much in their daily lives to the European policy concerning the protection of the environment , the strengthening of internal security , and the cooperation between the police and the legal system .
Mr President of the European Council , I consider it harmful to discuss internal differences of opinion here in the European Parliament .
This is important , for the European Union needs the United Kingdom as much as the United Kingdom needs the Union .
What is the main task of the European Commission ?
Is that not what is meant by a citizen 's Europe ? ( Applause ) We are against a European super state , President Chirac and Chancellor Kohl said .

What is their responsibility , if not conducting the correct dialogue at the right time ?
The death penalty may be imposed on the basis of a single accusation of having slandered Mohammed .
Such a religious law goes , of course , against our sense of justice and ideally we would prefer it to be revoked .
