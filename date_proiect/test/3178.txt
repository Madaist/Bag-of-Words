Although the report suggests some measures for developing systems and adopting protection mechanisms , specifically to protect privacy , in the face of this system - and other , similar ones ... and although it discusses measures of cooperation between Member States , which must take place at judicial level and not be information-gathering measures , on the basis of case-by-case analysis , under the supervision of the courts or even measures for monitoring information systems , particularly by national parliaments , what lies at the heart of all of this is that the system will continue to function and that an EU-level information system could be created and integrated into the CFSP and the CESDP , which is equally unacceptable .

Nevertheless , appropriations have been earmarked for the fisheries agreement with Morocco , which we all know will not be concluded , in an attempt to thereby freeze EUR 125 million in a category that is clearly experiencing difficulties .
