It is receiving an additional allocation of ECU 15 billion in order to compensate for the loss of its eligibility for Objective 1 , while the French Hainaut , which borders on it , is receiving nothing ; this discrimination is not justified either by the GNP or by the level of unemployment in the two regions .
I would like to add to what Mr Bourlanges said a moment ago , that institutional agreements cannot be considered separately .
I could add that the Cohesion Fund contributed to the conjuring trick that made some Member States into miracles of monetary union .
It is now up to them to have their say on the reform of European policies and integration .
A direct and across-the board reduction in compensatory aid will therefore upset the balance in European agriculture .
Although their responsibility is undeniable , we cannot restrict the causes of the conflict to those people alone .
The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations believes that the approach should be fully reversed and that the people should be given a say right from the preparation stage of the reform .
The European Union cannot remain indifferent to this situation .
I would like to discuss America , that vast country that claims to be the policeman of the world and the model of democracy , freedom and modernity .
He asked me if I took that as a response to what I was doing at the time in America .
I should say 'the most recent ' coup d 'Ã©tat , because goodness knows the Comoros have experienced a considerable number of them since gaining independence in 1975 : this is the eighteenth one to be recorded !
This is the first level of responsibility .
Mr President , I visited the Temelin power station that is under construction .
It is impossible to convince Europeans that European citizenship exists if they are daily being denied a fundamental right , the right to employment .
We have gradually moved from sectoral directives regulating various activities to a horizontal approach based on the principle of mutual recognition and two key directives from 1989 and 1992 .
The Commission then decided to get tough , not against those countries which refused to introduce social and environmental clauses in world trade rules , but against the Member States .
But if I say 'Villmools merci ' , I am sure you will understand , and it would surely not be against the Rules of Procedure just this once to use two words of Luxembourgish , one of which is French anyway .
This morning , I asked Nicole beforehand for some clarification and advice in case she did indeed occupy the Presidential seat today .

Another apparent sign of the increasing disinterest of the Europeans in European construction is the lack of interest in the euro , barely six months after its launch .
Furthermore , the appointment of the Secretary General of NATO as a representative of the European Common Foreign and Security Policy , appears to complete the picture , and brings to mind that phrase of a French diplomat who said that it is illusory to try to develop a European defence policy while building the European Central Bank in Fort Knox .
To this end , I would like to ask Minister Fischer if he envisages , apart from the conclusions of Cologne , a short or medium-term perspective on allowing accession to those countries which have not signed up to Article 5 of the amended Treaty of Brussels , that is , the mutual assistance clause which binds countries which are currently Members of the Western European Union .
I want to mention the relationships , which have sometimes been difficult , between the Commission and the Parliament .

This disastrous management of the Commission must come to an end .
It must never happen again , otherwise it will be the citizens who , justifiably , turn their backs on Europe .
We are still faithful to this fundamental choice and we would like to let you know that , in your difficult task , you will always find us to be speakers who are sometimes demanding but always anxious to help you and not to hinder you .
This will be a good demonstration from the outset of your desire for independence and your desire to see to it that the Commission is what the Treaty wants it to be ; that is , a Commission beyond countries , beyond national sentiments and also beyond the ideological preferences that we hold here within this Parliament .

We have spoken about Bosnia and have endlessly discussed the same problems of decentralisation .
Bitter derision and , material waste have added to the human and political damage , and we are now in the front line of Community confrontations , in a psychological situation which is aggravated by the destruction which we have brought about .
