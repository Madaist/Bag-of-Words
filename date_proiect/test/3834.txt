As the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) , we support the integration of the Doha Development Agenda on the basis of an integrated , ambitious and balanced outcome to negotiations .

The debate on toys and safety should really be held throughout the year .
Generally speaking , what we need are policies which call for an increase in the Community budget and which overturn the neoliberal framework of the Stability Pact and low deficits .
This confirms the European Union 's support for the creation of two states on the basis of the 1967 borders .
More importantly , in East Jerusalem , efforts are being made to create a palisade by erecting settlements around the city , so as to force the Palestinians to abandon their homes .
The continuing violation of human rights is sufficient cause for the European Union to impose sanctions on the basis of Article 2 of the treaty , because if , on the one hand , it chooses to support the peace process but , on the other hand , continues to upgrade economic relations with Israel without limitation , the only thing it will achieve is to serve Israel 's policy , which consists of forcing the Palestinians to abandon their land and expanding Israeli sovereignty to the whole of Palestine .

I consider that the liberalisation of trade and its catastrophic results , which have contributed to the current financial , economic , climate and food crisis , and to job losses , poverty and deindustrialisation , should be rejected .
I also voted against the motion because it does not safeguard full respect for the rights of governments to protect their ability to regulate and provide fundamental services , especially in the field of public goods and services such as health , education , culture , communications , transport , water and energy .
