Mr President , I view the expiry of the Euratom Treaty as an opportunity for Europe to phase out nuclear energy .
I welcome the fact that our American friends are involving the United Nations in this way .
From our group 's point of view , it is essential that we act jointly , not only at the level of intergovernmental cooperation .
