You are now waiting for the Commission to make you a counter-proposal and I believe in fact that an amended proposal from the Commission would now be welcome so that next December 's Council could finally be a Council that comes to a decision on a common position .
These incidents are seriously damaging to our Parliament 's image .
It is a missed opportunity , regretted by our group .
We ourselves want to emerge from the yoke of Maastricht Europe which , far from assuring peace and harmony among our peoples , is consigning them to limitless immigration and unbridled competition .
The budget reduction in funds allocated to transEuropean networks and structural funds is not a step in the direction of the fight against unemployment .
It is becoming a matter of urgency to define clear objectives and put together the necessary means , without which our regions risk permanently compromising their tourist potential .
There is still a vast amount to do .
One tends to get used to it and resolutions are not sufficient .
Her disappearance , in which elements of the Bangladeshi army may be implicated , is at the least worrying .
In less than one week , the twelve refugee camps of Uvira have been emptied .
The Commission is besides obliged to acknowledge that the restructuring of the European railway will go hand in hand with a high number of job losses .
We learn that we were getting ready to give way in the hormone affair , allowing the global extension of American legislation .
The Commission believes , like Parliament , that it is now necessary to protect the interests of the Community , its citizens and the undertakings established within its territory against the illegitimate extraterritorial effects of the laws adopted by the United States .
What kind of speech can you make when you have to talk simultaneously about salmon imports , fishery agreements with Seychelles and technical measures in community waters , and then expect a comprehensive answer ?
The Agreement provides for fishing licences for 57 European vessels , with financial compensation amounting to ECU 9.9 million , divided between the fishing rights as such , the financing of scientific programmes and educational schemes such as study awards .
Furthermore , the Community vessels are required to take on board two Seychelles seamen , an obligation which is complied with and often exceeded .
In conclusion , given that the basic economic assets of this agreement are the same as in the previous agreement , given the development value of this agreement and given the fact that the provisions concerning the declaration and monitoring of catches have been improved , I believe that our Parliament can support the adoption of this Agreement .
It is surely important to note that they are carried out by the French and Spanish monitoring authorities .
Finally , the guarantee of comprehensive implementation of the provisions of the ' Control Regulation ' , that is to say Regulation ( EEC ) No 2847/93 on satellite tracking and the recording of catches .
Thirdly , the Community has already ratified the constitution of the IOTC , whose jurisdiction , as I said earlier , is specifically the scientific monitoring and management of regional tuna stocks .
Now , once again , we face the same situation .
The principle of a European Rural Charter , providing a global framework for Community action in this field , is of course something we can all support .
In this context , bold innovations are possible , associated with the ecological concerns of our fellow citizens .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission congratulates Mr Hyland on his excellent report .
In fact , the promotion of the development of the rural areas is a priority of the Union , not only for economic and social reasons but also for the protection of the environment .
On this matter , the Commission has adopted an approach similar to that previously adopted by the Council with regard to exports of agricultural products .
It cannot therefore be accepted in its present form .
Every minute counts , Mr President , in spite of the praiseworthy efforts made by the Commission , the Council and the whole of Europe .
I shall not say anything about comitology , the mere mention of this word frightens me .
A vast programme indeed !
Developing countries on the other hand produce four times less polluting waste than the industrial countries while their population is four times as great .
It was , by the way , for this reason that the Council rejected them despite the pretext of limited funds .
The proposal for a regulation should therefore be regarded as complementary to existing aid schemes , mechanisms , procedures and interventions .
It is enough to quote just two figures on life expectancy here .
I think Eryl McNally has said everything that needs to be said about the Socialist Group 's support for Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz 's report .
Here again I would like to say how far this recommendation accords with the European Parliament 's wish for harmonization .
The report notes the fact , moreover , that there is no 'cost-result ' ratio given by the Commission in this area .
I now hope , as draftsman of the opinion , that there will be a majority in this Parliament to confirm our vote at the first reading on the essential points which have been brought up .
Was it not so that we could make Europe an area in which we could broadcast our own cultures through our own camera images and our own music , in front of a television audience of 370 million today , and one that may be 500 million tomorrow ?
