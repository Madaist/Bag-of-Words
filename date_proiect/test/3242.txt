Finally , the Third World is only in the very early stages of industrialisation .
As I see it , the fact that no agreement was reached was ultimately down to the intransigence of the European Union .
Some people value the European Union ' s stance because they stuck to their guns .
Climate change has a huge impact on the developing countries .
Behind all the fine words lurks political impotence .
Secondly , how do you intend to proceed in the coming months ?
Elections have just taken place in Romania , and we have been shocked at the outcome and the rise of a very extremist party .
That is what the people actually want to see .
In view of the extent to which public confidence has been undermined with regard to the euro , people need to see that we are taking steps forward .
We will assess the outcome of Nice on the basis of whether it leads to enhanced effectiveness , and efficiency , greater democracy and transparency , and that is what is on the agenda .
If majority voting does not become the general rule then decision-making will become irretrievably deadlocked , as Mr Prodi rightly commented a moment ago .

Again , I readily support any efforts to take preventive action in order to avoid war and all kinds of violence , but , of course , we must not twist the facts .

We want to work towards a culture of greater accountability
